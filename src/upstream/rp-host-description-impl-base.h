/**
 * Base implementation of most of Upstream::HostDescription, shared between
 * HostDescriptionImpl and LogicalHost, which is in
 * source/extensions/clusters/common/logical_host.h. These differ in threading.
 *
 * HostDescriptionImpl and HostImpl are intended to be initialized in the main
 * thread, and are thereafter read-only, and thus do not require locking.
 *
 * LogicalHostImpl is intended to be dynamically changed due to DNS resolution
 * and Happy Eyeballs from multiple threads, and thus requires an address_lock
 * and lock annotations to enforce this.
 *
 * The two level implementation inheritance allows most of the implementation
 * to be shared, but sinks the ones requiring different lock semantics into
 * the leaf subclasses.
